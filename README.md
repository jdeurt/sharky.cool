# sharky.cool
My new portfolio website thing. It automatically pulls from [my Github repository](https://github.com/jdeurt/sharky.cool) whenever a commit is made.

I promise nothing illegal this time.

**Enjoy!**

## Tips
* Add `_RAW` to the end of URLs to see the unrendered file.
* `/stuff` can be replaced with `/s` for shorter URLs.
* You can replace `index.html` with and underscore in a URL (`sharky.cool/s/kirby/index.html` -> `sharky.cool/s/kirby/_`).
