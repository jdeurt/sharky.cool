Oh man, another LFT. How many are we at, 6 in 2 seasons?

To be brief, don't play with this player. He is racist, transphobic, toxic, and a tiltbaby.

To elaborate, when he wasn't tilted he was a top 3 med in IM last season. When he tilted, it was more worthwhile for us to get an open med than to keep using him. 
He holds his teammates to a very high standard. You have to be better than top invite to meet it! Literally never make a mistake! If you make a mistake he will complain. If you make another different mistake he will start to bitch at you about it. Make a third mistake and he is tilted and once he is tilted he is gone. At best he'll go silent other than the noises of him breaking his headset, microphone, keyboard, or mouse. At worst he will start yelling at everyone on the team, swearing at them, and just being generally un-fun to play with. This tilting happens whether you are winning or losing. He can tilt even if you are 5-0-ing a team and are very clearly better than them. He doesn't care. And when he tilts, there is no coming back from it. He is gone and you should just get a different med.
My circlejerk was the only one that would continually defend him cuz we thought that as long as he fixed his tilting issue, he'd be super good! But he hasn't fixed the tilting. He didn't work on tilting and he won't ever work on it. He'll just change mains and think it'll fix the underlying issue of his mentality. 
The only full seasons this player has played have been with me. I've dealt with this man at his best and at his worst. I've cheered him on through thick and thin. And instead of leaving the team by calming explaining that he wasn't having fun (which is personal, so we can't argue against), he decided the best way to leave was to shit talk us, insult us, and burn the bridge.

So, don't play with him. His tryout may go well, but he will tilt. And his tilting makes TF2 the most un-fun thing you could be doing.
